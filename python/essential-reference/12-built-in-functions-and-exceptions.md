# 12.1 Built-in Functions and Types

Although you donâ€™t need to perform any extra imports to access these functions, they are contained in a module `__builtin__` in Python 2 and in a module `builtins` in Python 3.

```python
abs(x)

# Return True if all of the values in the interables s evaluates as True
all(s)

# Returns True if any of the values in the iterable s evaluate as True
any(s)

# Creates a printable representation of the object x just like the repr(), but only uses ASCII characters in the result
ascii(x)

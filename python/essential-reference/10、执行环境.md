# 10.1 Interpreter Options and Environment

Options are given to interpreter on the command line as follows:

```shell
python [options] [-c cmd | filename | - ] [args]
```

Interpreter Command-Line Arguments

| Options | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| -B | Prevents the creation of .pyc or .pyo files on import. |
| -E | Ignores environment variables. |
| -h | Prints a list of all available command-line options. |
| -i | Enters interactive mode after program execution. |
| -m | module Runs library module module as a script. |
| -O | Optimized mode. |
| -OO | Optimized mode plus removal of documentation strings when creating .pyo files. |
| -Q | arg Specifies the behavior of the division operator in Python 2. One of -Qold (the default), -Qnew, -Qwarn, or -Qwarnall. |
| -s | Prevents the addition of the user site directory to sys.path. |
| -S | Prevents inclusion of the site initialization module. |
| -t | Reports warnings about inconsistent tab usage. |
| -tt | Inconsistent tab usage results in a TabError exception. |
| -u | Unbuffered binary stdout and stdin. |
| -U | Unicode literals. All string literals are handled as Unicode (Python 2 only). |
| -v | Verbose mode. Traces import statements. |
| -V | Prints the version number and exits. | 
| -x | Skips the first line of the source program. |
| -c | cmd Executes cmd as a string. |

The program name appears after all the interpreter options. If no name is given, or the hyphen (-) character is used as a filename, the interpreter reads the program from standard input.

Interpreter Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Description |

| PYTHONPATH | Colon-separated module search path. |
| PYTHONSTARTUP | File executed on interactive startup. |
| PYTHONHOME | Location of the Python installation. |
| PYTHONINSPECT | Implies the -i option. |
| PYTHONUNBUFFERED | Implies the -u option. |
| PYTHONIOENCODING | Encoding and error handling for stdin, stdout, and stderr. This is a string of the form "encoding[:errors]" such as "utf-8" or "utf-8:ignore". |

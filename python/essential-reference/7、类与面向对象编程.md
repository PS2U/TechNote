Classes are the mechanism used to create new kinds of objects.

# 7.1 The `class` Statement

A `class` defines a set of attributes that associated with, and shared by, a collection of objects known as `instances`. A class is most commonly a collection of functions (known as `methods`), variables (which are known as class `variables`), and computed attributes (which are known as `properties`).

A class is defined using the `class` statement.

```python
class Account(object):
    num_accounts = 0
    def __init__(self,name,balance):
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance
        Account.num_accounts += 1
    def __del__(self):
        Account.num_accounts -= 1
    def deposit(self,amt):
        self.balance = self.balance + amt
    def withdraw(self,amt):
        self.balance = self.balance - amt
    def inquiry(self):
        return self.balance
```

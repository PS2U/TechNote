Classes are the mechanism used to create new kinds of objects.

# 7.1 The `class` Statement

A `class` defines a set of attributes that associated with, and shared by, a collection of objects known as `instances`. A class is most commonly a collection of functions (known as `methods`), variables (which are known as class `variables`), and computed attributes (which are known as `properties`).

A class is defined using the `class` statement.

```python
class Account(object):
    num_accounts = 0
    def __init__(self,name,balance):
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance
        Account.num_accounts += 1
    def __del__(self):
        Account.num_accounts -= 1
    def deposit(self,amt):
        self.balance = self.balance + amt
    def withdraw(self,amt):
        self.balance = self.balance - amt
    def inquiry(self):
        return self.balance
```

The values created during the execution of the class body are placed into a class object that serves as a namespace much like a module. 

```python
Account.num_accounts
Account.__init__
Account.__del__
Account.deposit
Account.withdraw
Account.inquiry
```

A `class` statement doesn't create any instances of class. Rather, a class merely sets up the attributes that will be common to all the instances that will be created later.

The functions defined inside a calss are known as `instance methods`. By Convention, the first argument is `self`, although any legal identifier name can be used.

Class variables such as `num_accounts` are values that are shared amongo all instances of a class.


# 7.2 Class Instances

Instances of a class are created by calling a class object as a function.This creates a new instance that is then passed to the `__init__()` method of the class.

```python
# Create a few accounts
a = Account("Guido", 1000.00) # Invokes Account.__init__(a,"Guido",1000.00)

a.deposit(100.00) # Calls Account.deposit(a,100.00)
b.withdraw(50.00) # Calls Account.withdraw(b,50.00)
name = a.name # Get account name
```

the dot(.) operator is responsible for attribute binding.


# 7.3 Scoping Rules

Although classes define a namespace, classes do not create a scope for names used inside the bodies of methods.

```python
class Foo(object):
    def bar(self):
        print("bar!")
    def spam(self):
        bar(self) # Incorrect! 'bar' generates a NameError
        self.bar() # This works
        Foo.bar(self) # This also works
```

The explicit use of `self` is required because Python does not provide a means to explicitly declare variables.


# 7.4 Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism for creating a new class that specializes or modifies the behavior of an existing class.

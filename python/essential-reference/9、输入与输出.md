# 9.1 Reading Command-Line Options

When Python starts, command-line options are placed in the list `sys.argv`.The first element is the name of the program.

```python
import sys
if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    sys.stderr.write("Usage : python %s inputfile outputfile\n" % sys.argv[0])
    raise SystemExit(1)
inputfile = sys.argv[1]
outputfile = sys.argv[2]
```

Raising `SystemExit` with a non-zero exit code is standard practice for reporting usage errors in command-line tools.

Use theUoptparse module for more complicated command-line handling.

```python
import optparse
p = optparse.OptionParser()
# An option taking an argument
p.add_option("-o",action="store",dest="outfile")
p.add_option("--output",action="store",dest="outfile")
# An option that sets a boolean flag
p.add_option("-d",action="store_true",dest="debug")
p.add_option("--debug",action="store_true",dest="debug")
# Set default values for selected options
p.set_defaults(debug=False)
# Parse the command line
opts, args = p.parse_args()
# Retrieve the option settings
outfile = opts.outfile
debugmode = opts.debug
```

Parsing is performed using the `p.parse_args()` method.This method returns a 2-tuple `(opts, args)` where `opts` is an object containing the parsed option values and `args` is a list of items on the command line not parsed as options.


# 9.2 Environment Variables

Environment variables are accessed in the dictionary `os.environ`.

```python
import os
path = os.environ["PATH"]
user = os.environ["USER"]
editor = os.environ["EDITOR"]
```

To modify the environment variables, set the `os.environ` variable, `os.environ["FOO"] = "BAR"`.

Modifications to `os.environ` affect both the running program and subprocesses created by Python.


# 9.3 Files and File Objects

The built-in function `open(name, [, mode, [, bufsize]])` opens and creates a file object,

```python
f = open("foo") # Opens "foo" for reading
f = open("foo",'r') # Opens "foo" for reading (same as above)
f = open("foo",'w') # Open for writing
```

The file mode is 'r' for read, 'w' for write, or 'a' for append.These file modes assume text-mode and may implicitly perform translation of the newline character '\n'.

If you are working with binary data, append a 'b' to the file mode such as 'rb' or 'wb'.This disables newline translation and should be included if you are concerned about portability of code that processes binary data.

A file can be opened for in-place updates by supplying a plus (+) character, such as 'r+' or 'w+'.

If a file is opened with mode 'U' or 'rU', it provides universal newline support for reading.

The optional `bufsize` parameter controls the buffering behavior of the file, where 0 is unbuffered, 1 is line buffered, and a negative number requests the system default.Any other positive number indicates the approximate buffer size in bytes that will be used.

File Methods

| Method | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| f.read([n]) | Reads at most n bytes. |
| f.readline([n]) | Reads a single line of input up to n characters. If n is omitted, this method reads the entire line. |
| f.readlines([size]) | Reads all the lines and returns a list. size optionally specifies the approximate number of characters to read on the file before stopping. |
| f.write(s) | Writes string s. |
| f.writelines(lines) | Writes all strings in sequence lines. |
| f.close() | Closes the file. |
| f.tell() | Returns the current file pointer. |
| f.seek(offset [, whence]) | Seeks to a new file position. |
| f.isatty() | Returns 1 if f is an interactive terminal. |
| f.flush() | Flushes the output buffers. |
| f.truncate([size]) | Truncates the file to at most size bytes. |
| f.fileno() | Returns an integer file descriptor. |
| f.next() | Returns the next line or raises StopIteration. In Python 3, it is called `f.__next__()`. |

The `read()` method returns the entire file as a string unless an optional length parameter is given specifying the maximum number of characters. The `readline()` method returns the next line of input, including the terminating newline.

Both the `readline()` and `readlines()` methods are platform-aware and handle different representations of newlines properly.

`read()` and `readline()` indicate end-of-file (EOF) by returning an empty string.

```python
while True:
    line = f.readline()
    if not line: # EOF
        break
```

A convenient way to read all lines in a file is to use iteration with a `for` loop,

```python
for line in f: # Iterate over all lines in the file
    # Do sth
```

In Python 2, the various read operations always return 8-bit strings, regardless of the file mode that was specified (text or binary). In Python 3, these operations return Unicode strings if a file has been opened in text mode and byte strings if the file is opened in binary mode.

`write()` and `writelines()` do not add newline characters to the output, so all output that you produce should already include all necessary formatting.

File objects also have the read-only data attributes.

| Attribute | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| f.closed | Boolean value indicates the file state |
| f.mode | The I/O mode for the file |
| f.name | Name of the file if created using open(). Otherwise, it will be a string indicating the source of the file. |
| f.softspace | Boolean value indicating whether a space character needs to be printed before another value when using the print statement. |
| f.newlines | When a file is opened in universal newline mode, this attribute contains the newline representation actually found in the file. |
| f.encoding | A string that indicates file encoding |


# 9.4 Standard Input, Output, and Error

The interpreter provides three standard file objects, known as standard input, standard output, and standard error, which are available in the sys module as `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stderr`.

`stdin` is a file object corresponding to the stream of input characters supplied to the interpreter. `stdout` is the file object that receives output produced by print. `stderr` is a file that receives error messages. More often than not, `stdin` is mapped to the userâ€™s keyboard, whereas `stdout` and `stderr` produce text onscreen.

The following code writes to standard output and reads a line of input from standard input:

```python
import sys
sys.stdout.write("Enter your name : ")
name = sys.stdin.readline()
```

Alternatively, the built-in function `raw_input(prompt)` can read a line of text from `stdin` and optionally print a prompt:

```python
name = raw_input("Enter your name : ")
```

Lines read by `raw_input()` do not include the trailing newline.This is different than reading directly from `sys.stdin` where newlines are included in the input text.

Keyboard interrupts (typically generated by Ctrl+C) result in a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception that can be caught using an exception handler.


# 9.5 The `print` Statement

Python 2 uses a special print statement to produce output on the file contained in `sys.stdout`. 

```python
print "The values are", x, y, z
```

For each object, the `str()` function is invoked to produce an output string. These output strings are then joined and separated by **a single space** to produce the final output string.The output is terminated by a newline unless a trailing comma is supplied to the `print` statement. In this case, the next print statement will insert a space before printing more items.

```python
print "The values are ", x, y, z, w
# Print the same text, using two print statements
print "The values are ", x, y, # Omits trailing newline
print z, w # A space is printed before z
```

To produce formatted output, use the string-formatting operator (`%`) or the `.format()` method.

```python
print "The values are %d %7.5f %s" % (x,y,z) # Formatted I/O
print "The values are {0:d} {1:7.5f} {2}".format(x,y,z)
```

You can change the destination of the `print` statement by adding the special `>>file` modifier followed by a comma.

```python
f = open("output","w")
print >>f, "hello world"
f.close()
```


# 9.6 The `print()` Function

`print` is turned into a function in Python 3. To print a series of values separated by spaces, just supply them all to `print()` like this:

```python
print("The values are", x, y, z) 
```


# 9.7 Variable Interpolation in Text Output

Many scripting languages such as Perl and PHP allow variables to be inserted into strings using dollar-variable substitutions (that is, `$name`, `$address`, and so on). Python provides no direct equivalent of this feature, but it can be emulated using formatted I/O combined with triple-quoted strings.

```python
form = """\
Dear {name},
Please send back my {item} or pay me {amount:0.2f}.
Sincerely yours,
Joe Python User
"""
print form.format(name='Mr. Bush', item='blender', amount=50.0)
```

For certain kinds of forms, you can also use `Template` strings, as follows:

```python
import string
form = string.Template("""\
Dear $name,
Please send back my $item or pay me $amount.
                                    Sincerely yours,
                                    Joe Python User
""")
print form.substitute({'name': 'Mr. Bush',
                        'item': 'blender',
                        'amount': "%0.2f" % 50.0})
```
